# Team Profile Generator

## Description

In this repository I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a team profile HTML file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4).

## Installation

  1. Fork the repository so that you have a local copy saved on your computer.
  2. Navigate to the forked repository on your computer using your command line application.
  3. Enter 'node index.js' in the command line application to start the Team Profile Generator.

Follow the instructions for installation to start the team profile generator. Answer the questions in your command line application to populate the team profile HTML file. Once you have answered all questions, a "team.html" file will be generated in the "dist" folder of your forked repository.
